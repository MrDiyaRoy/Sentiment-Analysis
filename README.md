# Sentiment-Analysis
Python Based- Sentiment Analysis using Machine Learning.
I used supervised learning to create my model. I have a CSV file which contains tweets and their sentiment. First I have cleaned the data by removing stopwords and "http" , special characters etc. After that I splited the data into training and testing. Then I divided the training data into two parts positive and negative and saved them as text file using which I trained my model.
